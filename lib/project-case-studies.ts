    problem:
      "Teams juggling several client companies could not see one truthful week: calendars lived in separate Google and Outlook accounts, conflicts were invisible until someone double-booked, and sharing live calendar links leaked join URLs and notes.",
    solution:
      "I built SyncForge so each company account gets a label and color, sources sync into one Postgres-backed schedule, and the team sees conflicts plus free time without exposing meeting links. Optional public page is busy/free only. Buyers who purchase a private deploy go through an install wizard that stores license details. Client production stays private; portfolio uses sanitized mock screenshots.",
